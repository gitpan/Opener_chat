OPener Chat

Description:
Opener Chat is a kind of multi-user and multi-protocol online communication software which is like Pidgin (gaim). 
Opener Chat is completely written by Perl which consists of the graphical interface part and net part. Now we use the module of win32::GUI to carry its interface into effect, so this software can only run on the win32 platform.
This software which is easy to operate supports server address of configuration, clients¡¯ log-in name, group or private chatting, program update, remote assisted function and chat records.
Opener Chat suits internal talk of small and medium enterprises or the Internet community. Adopting IRC protocol and using IRC service of freenode.net can avoid difficulties of establishing chat server by yourself. 
It is an open source software and no advertisement adds in. Besides, it occupies less resource and has greater extensibility.

INSTALLATION:
You do not need to install anything, just configure the setlogin.ini file first to set the sign-in account. 
Then set the settings.ini file to set the displayed settings. 
And lastly run start.pl directly.
